Opening ROM file
================

To open a ROM file goto::

    File -> Open

ROM files must have a `.gb` extension.

**Supported ROM files**

Currently only Gameboy ROM files are supported.

Game Saves
----------

Save files are stored to the open ROM directory as a `.sav` file.

For example if the following ROM file is open::

    C:\Users\me\ROMS\Game.gb

The following `.sav` file will be generated when Dotrix closes::

    C:\Users\me\ROMS\Game.sav
